Looping / Flow Control Statements / Iterative Nature :- It is technique used to avoid code repetition and to solve same task over and over agin till
given condition.

1. for 
2. while 


---> Lazy Functions and Eager Functions:- 

Lazy Function will send the data processing request at once whereas eager function sends the data one by one instantly it recieves

Eg:- for (lazy)
    while (eager)


--> For 

2 ways to play with for loop 

1. Lists, Strings 

Syntax:
for <variablename of iterator> in <list/string>:
    //Code Block Goes Here 



2. Normal Method 

for <variablename of iterator> in range(value):
    //Code Block Goes Here

---> While Loop 

Initializer 

condition 

updater (counter updater)

        ---> We need to define manually

Syntax:

while (condition):
    //Code Block Goes Here 
    //Updater
