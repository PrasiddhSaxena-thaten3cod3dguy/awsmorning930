#Functional Programming

---> To Solve Problems We require functions 
---> When it is same as normal Programming
---> Functions are reusuable in nature .  (KEY POINT)
---> We can create our own data type 

---> 2 Types of functions cat
1. Pre Built ( in - built functions):- Functions that comes along with the programming language itself. Like print(), len() etc.
2. User-Defined Functions :- The programmers are going to create functions. 

---> User -Defined functions

There are 4 Types

1. No Argument No return Value
2. No Argument But Return Value
3. Argument but no return Value
4. Argument and return value 

---> Argument:- Values / Parameters bu which the function can recieve dynamic inputs 
---> Return Value:- When Your function is done with the process it has generated o/p so the value generated if required later in the program can be retrieved with the help of return value. 

---> How to Work with functions in python 

We need to define the functions 

def <func name>(Argument):
    //Code Block Goes Here

1. No Argument No return Value


2. No Argument But Return Value

3. Argument but no return Value
